This is an iOS application that allows you to view webcomics from xkcd on your iPhone.

Download Details:
1. Optimized for iOS 7 and iPhone 5.
2. Not compatible with Ipad.

Application Details:
1. Uses the same API that feeds comics to xkcd.
2. There are two different options in this application, All comics or optimized comics.
3. All comics:
This options allows you to view all comics form XKCD. The first comic is a random comic chosen and the next and previous are sequential. 
After receiving the comics, I resize them to the best possible size and resolution to fit your screen
Note: Some comics will not be readable as they were too big to resize.
4. Optimized comics:
This options allows you to view comics from xkcd that are optimized for the iPhone 5 based on my algorithm and resizing. 
This displays comics that fit the screen perfectly and are readable. 
Note: The loading time for next and previous comics might be a little longer as it searches for the optimized comics.

I have added NSLOG statements for debugging.

If there is an error in getting the data, such as no internet connectivity, right now I have nslogged an error message. This can be easily changed to a pop up alert or some kind of notification or alert with a message.
